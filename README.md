# Buttons!

A collection of different styled buttons. Effects can be applied to links, buttons, etc. CSS code included. This project is mostly inspired from [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/) and other references.

[See content](https://haikhalfakhreez.github.io/Buttons/)

## How to Use
The documentation only showed the HTML and CSS for the first item of every category. Other items can be found in the ```CSS/buttons.css``` file which can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/haikhalfakhreez/Buttons). Just search using the codename displayed.

***Highly recommended to use the style you want together with the base class*** ```btn``` ***to make sure the style looks the same as displayed in the documentation.***

However, you can also modify it on your own.

To apply the style, either:
 - Copy and paste only the style you'd want to use in your own stylesheet. Style name can be found at the official [documentation](https://haikhalfakhreez.github.io/Buttons/). Or:
 - Reference the stylesheet and add the class name of the style to the element you'd want to apply.
